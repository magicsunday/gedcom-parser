1 CONT In Norse mythology, Frigg or Frigga was the mother goddess and the wif
1 CONC e of Odin or Odr. Considered queen of the heavens, the goddess of moth
1 CONC erhood, fertility, love and housework. Indeed strong parallels exist b
1 CONC etween Frigg and Freya of whom she may be a different aspect (cf. avat
1 CONC ar). Freya was a shaman practicting the seid and Frigg was reputed toh
1 CONC ave the ability to foresee everyone's destiny without revealing it. Th
1 CONC e mother of Baldur, she endeavoured to protect him from his preordaine
1 CONC d death by swearing oaths from everything in nature, but forgot the mi
1 CONC stletoe. It may be stated with a certain degree of truth that Frigg an
1 CONC d Freya are the same but different versions. Freya became Frigg after 
1 CONC she lived with the Aesir. Born a Vanir she became an Aesir by marriage
1 CONC , and as the wife of Odin she became a goddess of wifehood. However, p
1 CONC romiscuous Freya provided a lusty choice on his part. As Frigg shehad 
1 CONC an affair with Ve and Vili, Odin's brothers, according to Loki inLokas
1 CONC enna. This happened when Odin was gone for so long that everyonethoug
1 CONC h him dead (cf. Freya's crying golden tears when she thought Odr(Odin
1 CONC ) had disappeared).  Frigg's hall in Asgard is Fensalir. With her husb
1 CONC and, she was the mother of Bragi, Wecta and Hermod. Eir, a goddess of 
1 CONC healing, was one of her constant companions. She had attendantsnamed G
1 CONC lm and Syn.  She participated in the Wild Hunt (Asgardreid) along wit
1 CONC h her husband.  She had three attendants, Hlin, Gna and Fulla, all of 
1 CONC whom may have been the same deity in a different aspect as Frigg.  (Fr

1 CONC is wife and consort was the goddess Frigg who in the best-known tradit
